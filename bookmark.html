      <p>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing
        and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3
        from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km
        lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study
        the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.</p>
      <p>Lander payloads: surface thermophysical Experiment(ChaSTS) to measure the thermal conductivity
        and temperture;Instrument for lunar seismic Activity(ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the lading site;
        Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from
        NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.</p>

      <p>Rover payloads: Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS)
        for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.</p>


      <p> Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an
        objective
        of
        developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the
        capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical
        analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific
        payloads
        to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle
        injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the
        Propulsion
        Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander
        Module.
        The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic
        Parking
        Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.</p>

      <p>BENGALURU (KARNATAKA): Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Thursday said that all activities related
        to
        the Chandrayaan-3 Mission are on schedule and all systems are functioning normally.
        Taking to X (former Twitter), ISRO said, "Chandrayaan-3 Mission: All activities are on schedule. All systems are
        normal. Lander Module payloads ILSA, RAMBHA and ChaSTE are turned ON today. Rover mobility operations have
        commenced. SHAPE payload on the Propulsion Module was turned ON on Sunday."<br>

      <p>After a 40-day journey into space, the Chandrayaan-3 lander, 'Vikram', touched down on the uncharted lunar
        South
        Pole on Wednesday evening, making India the first country to do so.</p>
